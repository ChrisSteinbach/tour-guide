# **Architecture Overview**

WikiRadar is a Wikipedia-powered tour guide PWA. It uses spherical Delaunay triangulation to find nearby geotagged Wikipedia articles in O(sqrt(N)) time. The system has three phases: **extract** (Wikipedia dumps → article coordinates), **pipeline** (coordinates → binary triangulation), and **app** (binary → nearest-neighbor queries → UI).

## **End-to-End Data Flow**

```
Wikipedia SQL Dumps (geo_tags, page)
  ↓  extract-dump.ts: download, parse, join, deduplicate
data/articles-{lang}.json  (NDJSON: title, lat, lon)
  ↓  build.ts: per-tile toCartesian → convexHull → buildTriangulation → serializeBinary
data/tiles/{lang}/index.json + {row}-{col}.bin  (per-tile triangulations)
  ↓  pipeline.yml: compress → GitHub Release "data-latest"
  ↓  deploy.yml: download → decompress → bundle into dist/app/tiles/
GitHub Pages CDN
  ↓  tile-loader.ts: fetch index → fetch tile → deserializeBinary → IDB cache
FlatDelaunay (typed arrays in memory, per tile)
  ↓  NearestQuery.findNearest(): triangle walk → greedy vertex walk → BFS k-nearest
k nearest articles with distances
  ↓  render.ts → detail.ts → wiki-api.ts
User-facing PWA
```

## **I. Phase 1: Extraction**

**Entry point:** `src/pipeline/extract-dump.ts` — `npm run extract -- --lang=en`

Downloads two SQL dump files from `dumps.wikimedia.org` per language:

- `page.sql.gz` — article titles and IDs (~2 GB for English)
- `geo_tags.sql.gz` — geographic coordinates linked to page IDs (~600 MB)

The extraction runs in four steps:

1. **Download** (`dump-download.ts`) — Streams dumps with progress callbacks. Files are cached in `data/dumps/` across runs.
2. **Build page map** (`extract-dump.ts: buildPageMap`) — Parses the `page` dump into a `Map<page_id, title>`. Filters to namespace 0 (articles), excludes redirects.
3. **Join & stream** (`extract-dump.ts: streamGeoArticles`) — Streams `geo_tags`, joins each row with the page map, filters to `globe=earth`, `primary=1`, valid coordinates (not Null Island), and optional bounding box. Deduplicates by title.
4. **Write NDJSON** — One JSON object per line: `{"title":"Eiffel Tower","lat":48.8584,"lon":2.2945}`

The SQL dump parser (`dump-parser.ts`) handles gzip decompression, MySQL `CREATE TABLE` schema discovery, and `INSERT INTO ... VALUES` parsing with full MySQL escape sequence support. It streams rows one at a time to keep memory usage bounded.

Descriptions are not embedded in the extraction output. The app fetches them on demand from the Wikipedia REST API when the user opens an article detail view.

**Output:** `data/articles-{lang}.json` — ~1.2M articles for English.

## **II. Phase 2: Pipeline (Triangulation Build)**

**Entry point:** `src/pipeline/build.ts` — `npm run pipeline -- --lang=en`

Reads extracted NDJSON and produces per-tile binary files for the app:

1. **Read articles** — Parses NDJSON, applies optional `--limit` and `--bounds` filters.
2. **Assign to tiles** — Each article maps to a 5 degree lat/lon grid cell. See `docs/tiling.md` for the tiling strategy.
3. **Build per-tile triangulations** — For each populated tile, collect native articles plus a 0.5 degree buffer zone, then: `toCartesian` → `convexHull` → `buildTriangulation` → `serializeBinary`. Tiles with fewer than 4 articles are skipped.
4. **Write tile index** — `data/tiles/{lang}/index.json` manifest listing all tiles with bounding boxes, article counts, byte sizes, and content hashes.

**Output:** `data/tiles/{lang}/` (index.json + per-tile .bin files)

### **Binary Format**

```
Header (24 bytes, little-endian):
  [0..3]   vertexCount      uint32
  [4..7]   triangleCount    uint32
  [8..11]  articlesOffset   uint32
  [12..15] articlesLength   uint32
  [16..23] reserved         zeros

Numeric sections (typed array views):
  vertexPoints       Float32[V × 3]    xyz per vertex
  vertexTriangles    Uint32[V]         one incident triangle per vertex
  triangleVertices   Uint32[T × 3]     three vertex indices per triangle
  triangleNeighbors  Uint32[T × 3]     three neighbor face indices per triangle

Articles section (at articlesOffset):
  UTF-8 JSON string array of titles, zero-padded to 4-byte alignment
```

Float32 vertices give sub-meter precision on Earth. Uint32 indices and typed array views enable zero-copy deserialization in the browser. Article titles are stored separately to avoid bloating the numeric data.

## **III. Phase 3: App (PWA Frontend)**

**Root:** `src/app/` — `npm run dev`

### **1\. Startup**

1. Register service worker (auto-update mode)
2. Load triangulation for stored language (default: English)
3. Show welcome screen with language selector and "Find nearby" / "Use demo data" buttons
4. On start: begin GPS watch, render article list

### **2\. Data Loading (`tile-loader.ts`)**

The app uses geographic tiling — instead of downloading a monolithic file, it fetches a small tile index and then loads only nearby tiles on demand:

1. **Fetch tile index** — `loadTileIndex()` fetches `tiles/{lang}/index.json` (small manifest of all tiles with content hashes). Cached in IDB for offline use.
2. **Determine tiles** — `tilesForPosition()` computes the primary tile from the user's GPS position plus adjacent tiles if the user is within 1 degree of a tile boundary.
3. **Load tiles** — `loadTile()` fetches individual `.bin` files, calls `deserializeBinary()` (Float32→Float64 upcast for math precision, Uint32 views are zero-copy), and caches the result in IDB keyed by `tile-v1-{lang}-{id}` with content hash for freshness.
4. **IDB cache hit** — Returns instantly (~1ms). Compares the cached tile's hash against the index; only refetches tiles whose hash changed.

IDB uses a single object store with versioned key prefixes (e.g. `tile-index-v1-{lang}`, `tile-v1-{lang}-{id}`, `tile-lru-v1-{lang}`). Schema migration is handled by bumping the version in the prefix — old keys are orphaned and cleaned up on startup, avoiding the need for `onupgradeneeded` migration logic. See `idb.ts` for the full key inventory.

### **3\. Nearest-Neighbor Query (`query.ts`)**

The `NearestQuery` class wraps the flat Delaunay data for a single tile and provides `findNearest(lat, lon, k)`. Cross-tile merging is handled by `findNearestTiled()` in `tile-loader.ts`, which queries each loaded tile independently, de-duplicates by title, sorts by distance, and returns the top k.

Per-tile query steps:

1. **Triangle walk** (`flatLocate`) — Starting from `defaultTriangle` (or a warm-start hint), walk adjacent triangles by testing which edge the query point lies outside of. Each step crosses to the neighbor sharing that edge. Converges in O(sqrt(N)) steps.
2. **Seed vertex** — The closest vertex of the containing triangle.
3. **Greedy vertex walk** — Check all Delaunay neighbors of the current best; move to any closer one. Repeat until no improvement.
4. **BFS expansion** (k > 1) — Expand from the nearest vertex through Delaunay edges, collecting max(2k, k+6) candidates. Sort by distance, return top k.

Distance uses chord length (`2 * asin(||v - q|| / 2)`) rather than `acos(dot(v, q))` to avoid catastrophic cancellation with Float32-precision coordinates.

### **4\. Rendering (`render.ts`, `detail.ts`)**

**List view:**

- Article cards with distance badges
- Language selector dropdown and pause/resume button in header
- "Show more" button loads next tier (10 → 20 → 50 → 100)
- Smart re-render: if the article list is unchanged, only patches distance badges in-place (preserves dropdown/focus state)
- Re-query threshold: 15m minimum movement before recalculating

**Detail view:**

- Fetches article summary from Wikipedia REST API (`wiki-api.ts`)
- Displays thumbnail, description, extract, and links to Wikipedia and Google Maps directions
- In-memory cache for API responses

### **5\. PWA & Service Worker (`vite.config.ts`)**

- Static assets (JS, CSS, HTML, SVG) are precached by Workbox
- `.bin` data files use `NetworkOnly` — deliberately excluded from SW cache so that freshness checks always hit the server (the app manages its own IDB cache)
- Wikipedia REST API responses use `StaleWhileRevalidate` (max 200 entries, 1-week expiry)
- HTTPS dev server (required for geolocation API) with `0.0.0.0` binding for phone testing

## **IV. CI/CD**

### **1\. Data Pipeline (`pipeline.yml`)**

Runs monthly (1st of month, 03:00 UTC) or on manual trigger. Languages processed in parallel:

1. **Extract** — Downloads Wikipedia dumps (cached between runs), joins tables, outputs NDJSON
2. **Build** — Runs pipeline to produce tiled output (`data/tiles/{lang}/`)
3. **Compress** — Archives tile directories
4. **Publish** — Uploads tile archives to a `data-latest` GitHub Release

Smart merge: downloads the existing release first, so rebuilding one language preserves the others.

### **2\. Deployment (`deploy.yml`)**

Runs on every push to `main`:

1. Downloads tile archives from `data-latest` release
2. Decompresses tile files
3. Builds the app (`npm run build`)
4. Copies tile directories into `dist/app/tiles/`
5. Deploys to GitHub Pages

Data and app code are decoupled — data updates don't require app rebuilds, and app deploys pull the latest data from the release.

## **V. Geometry Library**

All modules live under `src/geometry/` and are shared by the pipeline and app.

### **1\. Coordinate System**

Points are represented as `Point3D = [x, y, z]` on a unit sphere. `toCartesian({lat, lon})` converts geographic coordinates:

```
x = cos(lat) × cos(lon)
y = cos(lat) × sin(lon)
z = sin(lat)
```

### **2\. Convex Hull (`convex-hull.ts`)**

Incremental 3D convex hull algorithm. For unit-sphere points, hull faces are exactly the spherical Delaunay triangles.

**Core predicate:** `orient3D(a, b, c, d)` — signed volume of tetrahedron. Positive means `d` is visible from face `(a, b, c)`.

**Degeneracy handling:** Points receive ~1e-6 random perturbation (reprojected onto the sphere) to prevent numerical ambiguity from coplanar/cospherical configurations.

**Per-insertion steps:**

1. Find a visible face via greedy walk from previous insertion point
2. BFS to discover all connected visible faces
3. Collect horizon edges (boundary between visible and non-visible)
4. Delete visible faces, create new faces connecting horizon to new point
5. Relink adjacency via half-edge map (edge `a→b` encoded as `a × N + b`)

**Spatial index:** `FaceGrid` (up to 128 cubed cells, scaling with cube-root(N)) provides O(1) fallback when the greedy walk fails.

### **3\. Delaunay Triangulation (`delaunay.ts`)**

`buildTriangulation(hull)` enriches hull output:

- Computes circumcenter and circumradius for each triangle
- Builds vertex-to-triangle mapping (entry point for walks)
- Drops interior points (those not on the hull), remaps indices
- Returns `SphericalDelaunay` with `originalIndices` mapping back to input

### **4\. Point Location (`point-location.ts`)**

- `locateTriangle(query, hint)` — Triangle walk: O(sqrt(N)) steps
- `findNearest(query)` — Locate triangle → closest vertex → greedy walk through Delaunay neighbors
- `vertexNeighbors(v)` — Walks the triangle fan around a vertex

### **5\. Serialization (`serialization.ts`)**

Two formats sharing the same logical structure:

|              | JSON (`TriangulationFile`)    | Binary         |
| :----------- | :---------------------------- | :------------- |
| **Vertices** | `number[]` (8 decimal places) | `Float32Array` |
| **Indices**  | `number[]`                    | `Uint32Array`  |
| **Articles** | `string[]`                    | UTF-8 JSON     |
| **Use case** | Intermediate / debugging      | Production     |

`deserializeBinary()` upcasts Float32 vertices to Float64 for math operations. Uint32 sections use zero-copy typed array views directly into the ArrayBuffer.
